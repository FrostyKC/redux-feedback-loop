# Redux Feedback Loop

## Description

This is a form that will submit feedback to a database. The app will ask a series of question, once the user enters in a value and clicks next, the next question will appear, and so on. When the questions are over the app will show a review page where the user can review the information they have entered. When submit is clicked from this page the app will send the feedback to the database, it will then thank you and give the option to give a new feedback.
